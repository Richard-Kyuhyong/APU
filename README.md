My name is Richard Kyuhyong Kim.  I teach investment related subjects.
Especially I teach how to form a portfolio, how to implment buy and sell timing in the stock markets with Python codes.
The students are suggested to study Python before coming to the class. 
The students will get used to the U.S. stocks market tickers. They will also
get introduced to the websites that are full of investment related information. 
With this know-how the students may start their investment in the U.S. stock markets immediately with much confidence.
