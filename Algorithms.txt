After studying the philosophy about money by going through "the attribute of money" we may go ahead with the
following topics.
1. Fundamental Analysis :  We learn how to use google to look for finance related websites. By looking at the websites
like marketwatch.com, yahoo finance.com, we learn how to get information about the firms that we are interested in. 
Especially we learn about how to evaluate value stocks and growth stocks. 
2. Chart Analysis : We learn that we get so much information through chart reading and many chart oriented indicators.
3. Python : we have to learn Python because we have to form a portfolio more rationally and do back-test to make 
sure that our timing strategy is adequate. Actually we learn Python to use the codes that are available in the Google. 
4. Practical portfolio optimizaztion and strategy back-testing using Python.
