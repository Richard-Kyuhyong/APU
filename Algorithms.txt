After studying the philosophy about money by going through "the attribute of money" we may go ahead with the
following topics.
1. Fundamental Analysis :  We learn how to use google to look for finance related websites. By looking at the websites
like marketwatch.com, yahoo finance.com, we learn how to get information about the firms that we are interested in. 
Especially we learn about how to evaluate value stocks and growth stocks. 
2. Chart Analysis : We learn that we get so much information through chart reading and many chart oriented indicators.
3. Python : we have to learn Python because we have to form a portfolio more rationally and do back-test to make 
sure that our timing strategy is adequate. Actually we learn Python to use the codes that are publicly available in Google. 
4. Practical portfolio optimizaztion and strategy back-testing using Python. 


After finishing this session we may go ahead with some advanced topics in the next session.  For example the next session 
introduces momentum strategies and mean-reversion strategies.  I wrote a few empirical articles on mean-reversion strategies
in the Korean Stock Market and found mean-reversion strategies are quite effective for Korean value stocks. According to the
back-test results, I came up with an practical idea to invest in Korean Stock and the current rate of return is 40% per
annum. Next step that I want to implement is pairs trading strategy.  I am studying on this topic more throughly!  And if I
come up with a better pairs trading strategies, then I would start my own investing.  All these stuffs will be taught in the
next session.
